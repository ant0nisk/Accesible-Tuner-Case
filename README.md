# Accessible Guitar Tuner case
A friend of mine made an open-source accessible guitar tuner case for the blind.
He gave one to me and I built it for a friend who plays the mandolin and he loved it.

This case was very intuitive for him, so I believe it is a good design. It is meant to be 3D-printable.

### Files
There are 2 folders with the STL and SolidWorks files for the 2nd and 3rd revision of the PCB. The STL files are ready to be printed.

The assembly files are only for visualisation purposes and test fitting.

The case for the 3rd revision is shown below:

It includes:
* Input and Output Guitar jack ports (marked with Braille)
* On/Off switch (marked with Braille)
* A potentiometer for the gain control
* Output port for headphones (from which the player can tune his/her guitar)

I hope the case helps someone. It was a fun project building it.

You might as well like my open-source Braille translator project. It is written entirely in Python and is easily extensible for many languages: https://github.com/ant0nisk/pybrl

I plan to add Math support soon and then completely convert PDF files into Braille (Grade 2 translation is supported).

I am currently testing a setup for an open-source and cheap Braille printer, but I don't have a solid design yet.

### Note
If you wish to modify the board and print braille on it, I would suggest reading the guidelines for printing braille from Braille Authority: http://www.brailleauthority.org/sizespacingofbraille/sizespacingofbraille.pdf
